Angular Lazy Loading Pages

Angular application that shows how to call 3 partials pages one at a time. The pages are access and loaded dynamically when you click on the link about, home or contact.

This is nice when you have lots of partials pages in a big applications and you only want to load what the user want to see.

This speed up the files transfer as you only start with the minimum files downloaded.
